The-Ultimate-F1-Experience

In recent years, Monza Racetrack has faced a concerning trend of deteriorating fan experiences, with long wait times, overcrowding, poor facilities, and limited access to amenities. After analyzing customer feedback across various platforms, two significant issues were identified, including difficulty accessing food vendors and limited viewing options. 

This project aims at addressing these problems, three product ideas have been proposed to improve the spectator viewing experience at F1 tracks. The first idea involves implementing the Bar Exchange concept to create designated fan areas supporting one particular team, with fluctuating prices of drinks and food items based on the activity level. The second idea involves live tracking of players in real-time through the dashboard, allowing fans to have a personalized view of the race and track their favorite racer. The third idea involves improving basic amenities at Monza track, such as introducing a component showing the waiting time of food trucks and restroom occupancy status.

Dashboarding:
These concepts are placed on a dynamic dashboard which is created using tableau.Data was generated from chat gpt and necessary wrangling was done to clean the data in R. 

These ideas could increase food and drinks sales, attract more fans to the track, and generate additional revenue. Therefore, an interactive dashboard has been proposed to enhance the spectator viewing experience at F1 racing.
